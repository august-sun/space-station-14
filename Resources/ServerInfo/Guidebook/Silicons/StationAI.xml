  The [color=cyan]Station AI[/color], not unlike [color=#a4885c]cyborgs[/color], is a [color=#a4885c]law-bound[/color] computer construct that works to assist the station's [color=#a4885c]crew[/color]. On most stations it can be found in a reinforced core, built mostly away from the main station body.

  ## AI General Abilities
  The [color=cyan]Station AI[/color] is able to:
  - Listen to and speak on all radio channels, including the exclusive-to-silicons [color=#2ED2FD]Binary[/color] ([color=#2ED2FD]:b[/color]) channel.
  - Access computers and any functions computers have (except for those that specifically require ID access, such as the Robotics Console).
  - Interact with [color=#a4885c]airlocks[/color] and other various electronic equipment, such as [color=#a4885c]air alarms[/color] and [color=#a4885c]APCs[/color].
  - Manage physical access to areas via door management, including opening/closing doors, bolting/unbolting doors, electrifying doors, and enabling/disabling emergency access.
  - Act as a dispatcher for the station's [color=#a4885c]cyborg[/color] population to rapidly inform them of situations needing their attention.

  The AI can only see where there are [color=#a4885c]surveillance cameras[/color], in areas too far from camera coverage, its vision appears as TV-static. The AI must be able to see a device in order to interact with it. To its player and to spectators, the location the AI is currently looking at is indicated by the [color=#a4885c]AI Eye[/color].

  ## AI Actions

  The AI has a set of unique, built-in interfaces that assist in the monitoring of the station, found in the action bar. These include:
  - Jump to core
  - Toggle camera lights
  - View laws
  - Communications Console
  - Crew Monitor
  - Crew Manifest
  - Mass Scanner
  - Station Records

  As a [color=#a4885c]law-bound[/color] silicon, the [color=cyan]Station AI[/color] must obey the laws programmed into it. The [color=#c96dbf]Research Director[/color] and [color=#fcdf03]Captain[/color] of the station have access to the [color=#a4885c]AI Upload Console[/color], a computer capable of reading the instructions printed on a [color=#a4885c]law board[/color] and storing them as the [color=cyan]Station AI[/color]'s [color=#a4885c]lawset[/color].

  Be aware that most servers have [textlink="rules" link="SiliconRules"] regarding [color=#a4885c]silicon laws[/color] and behavior.
